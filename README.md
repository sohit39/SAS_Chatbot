SAS Student Chatbot
  
  Intended to provide students at Singapore American School with an opportunity to have their own personal assitant in one of the platforms that they love the most--Facebook Messenger. This project integrates the basics of Natural Language Processing in understanding user text as well as complex web API usage via NodeJS in order to integrate all school technologies (e.g. Google Calendar, Schoology, PowerSchool etc.)
